    <!-- Problem 3 -->
    <h3>Problem 3 : Type Coercion</h3>
    <p id="p0">
    Type coercion is when javascript tries to make the effort to resolve possible compilation errors. Javascript does this through making assumptions about certain objects when they interact with each other.

    <br>

    For example, when doing something like: [[0]] + 1, one might expect this to return an error. In python, because you are adding a list to an int, it is natural for one to expect the compiler to return an error. However, in JS, through type coercion, the browser makes the assumption that the object can be cast to a string and then added to another number. This leads to a confounding result of "01".

    <br>

    Another example, would be the following: null + 2, one might expect this to return an error. In python, because you are adding an object of Nonetype to an int, there will be no supported operator capable of accomplishing this. JS, however, assumes that the null is 0, and adds the two to return the strange result of 2.

    <br>

    <script>
      // Examples of number:
      console.log("--- These are examples of JS Black Magic ---");
console.log("[[0]] + 1");
console.log([[0]] + 1);
console.log("null + 2");
console.log(null + 2);
    </script>

    <h3>Problem 4 : Policy on Late/Unreadable Work</h3>
    <p id="p0">
    Regardless of the circumstances or situation of the student, if the work submitted is late (regardless of how many ms past the due date), the work recieves a 0. If the work is submitted and cannot be accessed by the grader, the work recieves a 0. No ifs and no buts, just get the work done and submit well in advance.
