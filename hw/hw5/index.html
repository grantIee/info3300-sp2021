<b>1D. Relationship Between Carats and Price</b>

We see that for the most part there is a non-linear relationship between the carats and the price. It almost seems that there is an exponential relationship. However, we see that as the carats get larger, there is a larger range in the price of the diamond. For instance at 1.0 carat the price looks to range from $2,000 to $16,000, whereas the price for something with a smaller amount of carats is a lot more contained.
